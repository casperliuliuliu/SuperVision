# Fourier Transform

* What is the purpose of fft?

* What is the meaning of magnitude in image?

* What is the meaning of phase in image?

* What is the meaning of real part in image?

* What is the meaning of imaginary part in image?

* What would happen to original image if I do math on the fft result, and ifft?

* What is the relation between cosine, sine and FFT?

* Why is the distribution being log? Not slower(linear, polynomial), or faster(log log)?
